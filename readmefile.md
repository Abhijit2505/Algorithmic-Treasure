    <b> PROJECT DESCRIPTION  </b><br>
    <p>Many time, when an interview approaches, candidates start searching for different algorithms in different programming languages for practise. This project aims to build a website which will contain the codes along with the techniques and explanations so that it can be helpful for many.</p>
</div>
<div>
<b>RELEVANT TECHNOLOGY </b> <br>
<p>I have used Python to code out the algorithms</p>
</div>

<div>
  <b> Question 1 </b> <br>
  <p> ** Remove duplicate elements from sorted array**</p>
  <p> Given a sorted array arr[] of size N. The function remove_duplicate takes two arguments(arr,n) . The first argument is the sorted array arr[ ] and the second argument is 'N' the size of the array and returns the size of the new converted array arr[ ] with no duplicate element.
  <p> <b> Input Format: </b><br>
   The first line of input contains T denoting the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow . The first line of each test case contains an Integer N and the next line contains N space separated values of the array A[ ] .
  </p>  
  <p><b> Output Format: </b> <br>
   For each test case output will be the transformed array with no duplicates.
   </p>
 </div>
<div>
  <b> Question 2 </b> <br>
  <p> **First Repeating Element**</p>
  <p>Given an array arr[] of size N.  The task is to find the first repeating element in an array of integers, i.e., an element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest.
  <p><b>Input : </b> <br>
  <p>The first line contains an integer T denoting the total number of test cases. In each test cases, First line is number of elements in array N and second its values.
  </p>
  <p><b>Output: </b><br>
  Print the index of first repeated element, if there is not any repeating element then return “-1” (without quotes).

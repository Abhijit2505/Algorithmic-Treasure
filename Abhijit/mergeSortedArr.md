#### Problem Statement 
There are two sorted arrays **num1** and **num2** of size m and n respectively. 

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be **O(log (m+n))**.
You may assume **num1** and **num2** cannot be both empty.

    Example 1:

    nums1 = [1, 3]
    nums2 = [2]

>> The median is 2.0

    Example 2:

    nums1 = [1, 2]
    nums2 = [3, 4]

>> The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
